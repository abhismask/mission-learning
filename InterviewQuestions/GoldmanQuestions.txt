1) 2nd smallest element of an unsorted array.
2) 2nd smallest element of a sorted rotated array. E.g. 5,6,1,2,3,4
3) Set of anagrams of list of words. The output should be words which are anagrams from the list should be grouped together.
4) Minimum distance between 2 words counting the number of characters from middle of both words. E.g. ABC is XYZ and ABC & XYZ are two distinct words. Minimum distance between ABC and XYZ
5) First unique character of a string. E.g. aabdcce . Output : d
6) Largest substring with unique characters e.g. aaabcbdeaf Output : cbdeaf
7) Print matrix in spiral form e.g. {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}} Output . 1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5
8) Program to add two fractions and result in lowest form
9) Largest palindrome in a given string
10) Return element from a Pascal Traingle - Given 5,2 as input return 2 nd element from 5th row
11) Given a String “aabbbbddcc” find the longest first repeating index and its length.  (Input: “aabbbbddcc”  Output: [2,4] 2 is the index and 4 is the length).
12) Arrange given numbers to form the biggest number.Input- List of numbers : {1, 34, 3, 98, 9, 76, 45, 4}   Output – 998764543431
13) Find out the number of pair from given integer array whose sum is equal to a given number.
14) Missing characters to make a string Pangram
15) Check if a number is a power of another number
16) Given Input,print the following input: “SSSSSTTPPQ”  Output: “5S2T2P1Q”.
17) Find the nth Number in fibonacci series using Iterative and Recursive Approach.
18) Given node in Binary Search tree, write the implementation for Put , Contains and InOrder methods.
19) Write a method for ATOI functionality (ASCII to Integer conversion)
20) Find if a given number is Armstrong number - Example: 371 = 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3
21) Given a set of numbers identify pairs such that a^b = b^a
22) Given an array of Employees with name,marks. Find out the maximum average marks from the list.
String[][] scores={{"Bobby","123"},
{"Alia","-678"},
{"Bobby","100"},
{"Alex","223"},
{"Alex","-23"},
{"Bobby","723"}
};
Avg Bobby = 315,Alex= 100,Alia=-678. Result: 315
23) Given an m*n matrix, print the matrix in reverse spiral form using recursion.
24) Find the smallest subarray whose sum is equal or greater than the target value
25) Given a program to reverse a string which is incorrect. Need to debug and fix it to run executing all test cases successfully
26) Find the dot product of two arrays - mean array1[i] * array2[i] (if the length of the two arrays are not equal then the loop should go for the lesser length).
27) Find square root
28) Find list of all unique tuples (of a given size) for a given string . Eg. "bba" and size of tuples is 2 answer should be ["bb","ba"]
29) Give a log file, find IP address from which maximum hits are coming. Log follows a specific format, it starts with IP address
